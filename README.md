# www.aimmxi.xyz
www.aimmxi.xyz is a repository that documents all the significant things I have made, and it also serves as my own space on the internet.

The aim of this project is to offer a platform in which I can post whatever I want in the format I want, to document what I make, preserve the things I deem important and, perhaps, make the Internet slightly less boring in the process.

The website is released under the GPLv3 license and the content under CC BY-SA.

Thanks for the visit !
